# conky
My conky config

Pklaying with conky for the first time. I have the location for files hard coded in the conf and sh file so that might hav to change.
Th conf file calls the script to read the weather

Using https://openweathermap.org/ you will need to get your own API key. It's free.
This is used in the script that gets the weather data to be using in conky

this script creates 4 file a json for the weather data and 3 txt file to convert unx time into human time.
