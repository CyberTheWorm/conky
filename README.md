# conky
My conky config needs conky.conf and ConkyWeather.sh

Playing with conky for the first time. I have the location for files hard coded in the conf and sh file so that might have to change.
The conf file calls the script to read the weather

Using https://openweathermap.org/ you will need to get your own API key. It's free.
This is used in the script that gets the weather data to be using in conky.

This script creates 4 files, a json for the weather data and 3 txt files to convert unx time into human time.
